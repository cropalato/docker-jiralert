# Description

The project https://github.com/prometheus-community/jiralert do not create new releases and docker image since Feb 17, 2023.
This project will create new docker images based on snapshots from https://github.com/prometheus-community/jiralert (master branch).


# Version

I have no idea/control how the project will define the master branch version, so the tag used in docker images be based in unix epoch timestamp. ex: master_1716568827
